\section{Summary and Conclusion}

The first objective mentioned in section 1.4 is achieved by conducting comparative analysis of $k-\epsilon $ and $k-\omega $ turbulence models on SedFOAM solver and the second and third objective are being achieved by developing a model integrating a one-way coupling mechanism between the existing OpenFOAM pimple solver and the DEM solver on body-fit-immersed boundary geometry representing a particle. It demonstrates the practicality of the OpenFOAM-based CFD-DEM framework, which integrates the OpenFOAM${^{\circledR}}$ CFD toolbox OpenFOAM-v2312 with the custom DEM code implemented in OpenFOAM. The conclusions are summarized in the following points:\par

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Among two equation RANS turbulence model, $k-\omega $ turbulence model better represents sediment flow dynamics near bed region in two phase Eulerian Eulerian solution approach.\par
	\item  The CFD-DEM solver employs a body-fitted immersed boundary method to precisely model cubical sediment particles in OpenFOAM, surpassing the constraints of traditional spherical assumptions.\par
	\item  The simulation of settling velocities for cubical particles aligns closely with the experimental data, verifying the solver's applicability to the free sedimentation problem with one-way coupling.\par
\end{enumerate}

The solver is presently limited to single particle cases and needs further development of two-way coupling and multi-particle interactions to simulate complex sediment transport like bedload movement.\par

\section{Recommendations for Further Work}

The CFD-DEM solver implemented in OpenFOAM in the project is at its initial stage and lots of implementations are to be made to develop a robust and competitive tool for CFD-DEM analysis in the academic and professional sector. The further implementations required in the solver are:\par

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Particle-Particle Interaction in DEM solver\par
	\item  Particle interactions as source terms in the fluid solver in the momentum equation\par
	\item  Two-way and four-way CFD-DEM coupling mechanism\par
\end{enumerate}
